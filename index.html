        <h2>📜 About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack web-developer based in India.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started coding back in 2020 during the lockdown. From knowing nothing to building something I have come a long way. But this is just the start.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love dogs because they are my best friends in this lonely world (😂 just kidding). I also love interacting with people a lot.

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>

        <p>
          I have worked in many projects although most of them are my personal projects. I have recently worked on an covid based group-project which was a lot of fun.
        </p>

        <h2>🏆 Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          In terms of accomplishments, I have not achieved something great. Although I have done few interships here and there and achieved some badges in FrontEnd Mentor but its not that great.

        <h2>👨‍💻 Work History</h2>

        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>
          I am a open source enthusiast (well, I guess most of the developers are). I have contributed to many projects but none have contributed to mine 😢
        </p>
        <h3>Giving Money</h3>
        <p>
          I have watched several videos and clicked on numerous ads to contribute to the developers.
